name: Container Build And Upload
description: |
  Builds and uploads to GHCR (GitHub Container Registry) the container used to build the Qualcomm debian packages.
  This workflow will assumes the build architecture is amd64 (x86_64) since the github's 'ubuntu-latest' runs-on tag
  is used. Using docker's buildx, the Dockerfile in this repo's docker/ folder will be built for amd64 and cross-compiled
  for arm64.
